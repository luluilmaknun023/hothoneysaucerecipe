<p style="text-align: justify;">Hot Honey Sauce infused with spicy peppers is a new kind of add-in to some of your recipes. It is very addictive, sweet/spicy and works great in many everyday recipes like meat, fish, or veggies.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EQUIPMENT :</strong><br />- Saucepan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>INGREDIENTS :</strong> <br />- 1 cup honey.<br />- 3 dried peppers. <br />- 4 fresh small chilli peppers.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>INSTRUCTIONS :<br /><br /></strong>1. Take a cutting board and cut dried and fresh peppers your way. <br />2. Take a medium saucepan and on medium heat, add the chilli peppers and pour honey. Pour the quantity you want to use. <br />3. Gently stir and bring to a bare simmer, but don&rsquo;t boil. When you see that it barely starts to boil, turn the heat to low and let the sauce cook for about 20-30 minutes to infuse spicy and chilli aromas. Adjust spicy pepper flakes if you don&rsquo;t feel it that spicy and hot. <br />4. Remove the pan from the stove and pour the mixture into a jar with the help of a strainer. Store the sauce in a cool/dark place.</p>
